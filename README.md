### Hey there

- I am currently working at [Vijay's Lab](https://github.com/vijaybioinfo) investigating the immune system in the context of diseases like cancer, asthma, and viral infections.
- My research interests include:
  + Computational modelling
  + Bioinformatics and software development
  + Gene regulation
  + Single-cell multi-omics
- I am currently looking for a PhD Programme where I can expand and develop further my skills and the above interests.

Please feel free to contact me to ciro@lji.org or ksuasteguic@gmail.com, or on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/cramsuig).
